# custom-CLI-quiz
  It is a command-line interface based quiz made using Vanilla Javascript to test your understanding of Flowers.
  This quiz consists of 4 levels. 3 points each. 
  If you answer all questions correctly, you get the total 9 out of 9 points, which is maximum score. 
  If you answer any question incorrectly, you get out of game after that particular level finishes, and you could not get maximum score. 
  Feel free to check the game. [Link is here too.](https://repl.it/@simrananand/ex14?embed=1&output=1#index.js)
