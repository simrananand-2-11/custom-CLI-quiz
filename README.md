# custom-CLI-quiz

  It is a command-line interface based quiz made using NodeJS to test your understanding of Flowers.
  
  This quiz consists of 3 levels. 3 points each. 
  
  If you answer all questions correctly, you get the total 9 out of 9 points, which is maximum score.
  
  If you answer any question incorrectly, you get out of game after that particular level finishes, and you could not get maximum score.
